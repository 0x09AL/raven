## How it works

The main idea is that given a company name, searches all possible matches of Linkedin Employees in Google and then extracts their data. Based on that, it can build e-mail addresses in different formats, export them and also check them in haveibeenpwned.com.

The previous version of raven allowed you to extract data only after finishing a scan and only in a specified format. In case you wanted to extract the same info but with a different e-mail format , you needed to re-run the scan which wasn't very practical.

In this version it is possible that given a scan, you can export the data as many times as you want, in different formats and also check them in haveibeenpwned.com with only one command.

# Scan

A ```Scan``` is the process of extracting the public information from Google and Linkedin and storing it in the database.

To create a scan you can run the command ``` new scan ``` this will bring you to the scan instance. There are some properties that should be configured before running a scan as can be seen below.

* ```Scan_id``` - Can't be changed, is the scan id which is used as a PK in the database.
* ```Scan_name``` - The name of the scan, used later when you want to export data.
* ```Company``` - The name of the company that you want to extract employees.
* ```Domain``` - This is the subdomain of the main LinkedIn website. If you want to target a specific country you can specify the subdomain. For example , Albania has the subdomain ```al```. In case you don't know the subdomain use ```www```.
* ```Pages_number``` - The number of Google pages to extract information from.

Running the command ```options``` you can see the properties and values that are assigned.

Below is an example scan:

After setting the properties you can use ```start``` to start the scan.
The scan will insert the data in the database so that you can use it later.

# Export

After finishing the scan, you can use the data by running ```use (scan_name)```.
This will bring you to export instance. The export instance allows you to export the data in different formats and check them in haveibeenpwned.com .

The export instance has 3 properties.

* ```Format``` - The format of the e-mails.
* ```Domain``` - The domain to append to the "usernames".
* ```Output``` - Filename to write the output.

Below are the avaible formats. You can use also the ```ALL``` in case you want to generate all the avaiable formats, and then use a custom tool to verify the e-mail addresses.

After specifying a format and a domain, you can export them using the ```export``` command or check if they have been breached by using the ```checkpwned``` command as can be seen below.
